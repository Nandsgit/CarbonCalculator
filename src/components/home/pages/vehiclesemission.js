            The Transportation sector includes the movement of people and goods by cars, trucks, trains, ships, airplanes, and other vehicles. 
            The majority of greenhouse gas emissions from transportation are carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions resulting from the combustion of petroleum-based products, 
            like gasoline, in internal combustion engines. The largest sources of transportation-related greenhouse gas emissions include passenger cars, medium- and heavy-duty trucks, 
            and light-duty trucks, including sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks, and minivans. These sources account for over half of the emissions from the transportation sector. 
            The remaining greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector come from other modes of transportation, including commercial aircraft, ships, boats, and trains, 
            as well as pipelines and lubricants.

            Relatively small amounts of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) are emitted during fuel combustion. In addition, a small amount of hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) 
            emissions are included in the Transportation sector. These emissions result from the use of mobile air conditioners and refrigerated transport.

        The transportation sector is one of the largest contributors to anthropogenic U.S. greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. 
        According to the Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks 1990â€“2018 (the national inventory that the U.S. prepares 
        annually under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change), transportation accounted for the largest portion (28%) of total 
        U.S. GHG emissions in 2018. Cars, trucks, commercial aircraft, and railroads, among other sources, all contribute to transportation end-use sector emissions.
